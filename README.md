## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** "I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. 'node-' in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and '-mation' for 'automation' which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on 'n8n'." - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**

## Puppeteer 사용 방법

이 n8n 배포에는 Puppeteer가 설치되어 있습니다. Puppeteer는 웹 스크래핑, PDF 생성, 자동화된 UI 테스트 등을 수행할 수 있는 Node.js 라이브러리입니다.

### Render에서 배포하기

1. Render 계정에 로그인합니다.
2. "New +" 버튼을 클릭하고 "Web Service"를 선택합니다.
3. 이 저장소를 연결합니다.
4. 환경 변수를 설정합니다 (데이터베이스 연결 정보 등).
5. "Create Web Service"를 클릭합니다.

### Puppeteer를 사용하는 코드 노드 예제

```javascript
// 코드 노드에서 Puppeteer 사용 예:
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

async function execute() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: true,
    args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
  });
  
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  
  // 페이지 내용 가져오기
  const content = await page.content();
  
  // 스크린샷 찍기
  await page.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/screenshot.png' });
  
  await browser.close();
  
  return { content };
}

return execute();
```
